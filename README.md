# Lex Profanity Checker in LEX/C.

This is an implementation of a lex

## What This Is

This is an implementation of a Lex parser designed to demonstrate knowledge of regex.

### Running

Unix users need only proceed with the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ ./run.sh
```

Windows users will need to compile themselves. Simply run the executable after compilation. I use gcc. There are no crazy libraries here only stdlib, string, and stdio.

### Manifest


```
makefile
```
Compilation instructions for users machines.


```
run.sh
```

Setup utility for (\*)nix users.

```
lexparse.l
```
Parser rules and function implementations. Everything is in here.

```
in.c
```

Test file for input. C code example.
